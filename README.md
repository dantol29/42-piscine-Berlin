# C Piscine
This repository contains coding developed at 42Berlin's C bootcamp (also known as Piscine), from 25/sept/2023 to 20/oct/2023.

## About 42

42 is an innovative coding school that offers a unique approach to education.
 It's known for being tuition-free and open to students from all backgrounds. 
At 42, learning is hands-on and project-based, and the emphasis 
is on developing practical coding skills and problem-solving abilities.
The so-called "C Piscine", a 26-day C programming bootcamp,
is the last stage in the selection process for becoming a 42's student.

## Skills

### C Language
	The primary language learned at the 42's Piscine is C: dealing with variables,
	pointers, memory allocation, macros, as well as creating functions and programs,
	including the use and creation of libraries and Makefiles.

### Shell
	The first two days of the bootcamp are dedicated to learning basic to intermediate
	shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the terminal.

### Git
	All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, which demands students to
	be at ease with such a system.
 
### Makefile
        We used Makefile to define the build process of a project,
	specifying dependencies and instructions for compiling source code into executable programs.

## Soft skills

### Self-learning and proactiveness
	At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There
	are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling, enquiring
	your classmates, and empirical knowledge, each student learning at their own pace.

### Teamwork
	On weekends, a 48h team project called "Rush" is proposed: a 3-member group randomly
	chosen by the school's system must collaboratively develop a fully running application.
	The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge levels while finding a
	common work methodology that allows all team members to contribute to the project.

### Time management and resiliency
	The school is open 24/7. Thus, the so-called "pisciners" are free to work whenever
	they want, which demands excellent time management skills and resiliency for not
	"drowning" amid the massive load of work demanded by the non-stop 26-day program.
